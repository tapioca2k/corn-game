# Farmville Royale
I made this for a game jam. To build it, you'll need to install Monogame and Visual Studio (2019?). 

Go to the "Releases" tab for an exe.
Gamepad controls are listed ingame (player 1 can use the dpad to select the level) but these are the keyboard controls for player 1:
	*  W/A/S/D move (A/D select map in menu)
	*  L corn missile
	*  K dash
	*  J corn invisibility
	*  1-4 ready up (on the menu)
